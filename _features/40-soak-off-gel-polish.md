The gel polishes and Japanese soak-off gels used at Color Treats are much more gentle and flexible for natural nails than acrylics or hard gels. They remove quickly and easily without the need for heavy drilling, which can cause damage to your nails. And soak-off gels are made with color quality in mind, using vibrant pigments that bring out the best in your designs.

**Soak-off gel** is thicker than other polishes, and protects nails from the elements. It lasts 3 to 5 weeks, and is great for people who want long-lasting, stronger natural nails.

**Gel polish** is thinner, so it looks and feels more like the natural nail. It generally lasts 2 to 3 weeks, and is better for those who want to change their designs more often.
