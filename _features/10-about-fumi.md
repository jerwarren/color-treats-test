Born and raised in Japan, famous for its nail fashion, Fumi has been studying nail care and art since 2002. She’s studied in Japan, Australia and America, and currently holds seven certifications in the practice, as well as salon experience in massage, reflexology and aromatherapy.

Fumi moved to Portland from her hometown of Hamamatsu, Japan, in 2011, and immediately noticed the difference between Japanese and American nail art—more specifically, the lack of the latter. She cares greatly about quality nail care and relaxation, and wants to bring those values to clients here in the States.
