Fumiâ€™s dry pedicure uses a new, more effective and environmentally friendly technique which uses far less water, with less chance for bacterial infection than traditional pedicures. And unlike other salons, Fumi pays just as much attention to exfoliation and cuticle care with pedicures as she does with manicures, using her background in massage to ensure clients are relaxed and comfortable during their service.
